seq2seq script based on paper by Ilya Sutskever(https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)

We performed an accent modification using this script. Data can be queried at accent.gmu.edu

Script has 4 keys:

--path_to_dataset:
    path to the dataset. Dataset is a txt file where each line represents a pair or words deparated by tab character. Each lines ends with \n character
    Sample dataset can be found here: http://www.manythings.org/anki/

--num_samples:
    number of pairs to be processed

--num_epochs:
    number of epochs

--path_to_model:
    path to the file to save the model weights

example of the running command:

python seq2seq_final.py --path_to_dataset ./data/russian-to-gma.txt --num_samples 1000 --num_epochs 10 --path_to_model ./data/model.h5
